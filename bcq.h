/* Bounded Concurrent Queues, untrusted consumer
 *
 * This is a producer/consumer circular buffer, in which the producer never
 * blocks and does not need to trust the data structure (which is writable by
 * the consumer).
 *
 * A producer enqueues an item, based on the indexes of the producer and
 * consumer.  Enqueue cannot block, but can fail if the queue is full or if it
 * fails to enqueue after a certain amount of tries.
 *
 * prod_idx:     the next item to be produced
 * cons_pvt_idx: the next item a consumer can claim
 * cons_pub_idx: the last item (farthest left / oldest) that hasn't been
 *               consumed/made ready to be clobbered by the producer (it is
 *               what the consumer produces).  Once all are clear, this will be
 *               the same as the prod_idx.
 *
 * The number of free slots in the buffer is: BufSize - (prod_idx - cons_pub)
 * The power-of-two nature of the number of elements makes this work when it
 * wraps around, just like with Xen.  Check it yourself with a counter of 8 and
 * bufsizes of 8 and 4.
 *
 *
 * General plan:
 *
 * Producers compete among themselves, using the prod_idx, to get a free spot.
 * Once they have a spot, they fill in the item, and then toggle the "ready for
 * consumption" bool for a client.  If it cannot find one after a number of
 * tries, it simply fails (could be a DoS from the client).
 *
 * Consumers fight with their private index, which they use to determine who is
 * consuming which item.  If there is an unconsumed item, they try to advance
 * the pvt counter.  If they succeed, they can consume the item.  The item
 * might not be there yet, so they must spin until it is there.  Then, the
 * consumer copies the item out, and clears the bool (rdy_for_cons).
 *
 * At this point, the consumer needs to make sure the pub_idx is advanced
 * enough so the producer knows the item is free.  If pub_idx was their item,
 * they move it forward to the next item.  If it is not, currently, they spin
 * and wait until the previous consumer finishes, and then move it forward.
 * This isn't ideal, and we can deal with this in the future.
 *
 * Enqueue will enqueue the item pointed to by elem.  Dequeue will write an
 * item into the memory pointed to by elem.
 *
 * The number of items must be a power of two.  In the future, we'll probably
 * use Xen's rounding macros.  Not using powers of two is a pain, esp with mods
 * of negative numbers.
 *
 * Here's how to use it:
 *
 * DEFINE_BCQ_TYPES(my_name, my_type, my_size);
 * struct my_name_bcq some_bcq;
 * bcq_init(&some_bcq, my_type, my_size);
 *
 * bcq_enqueue(&some_bcq, &some_my_type, my_size, num_fails_okay);
 * bcq_dequeue(&some_bcq, &some_my_type, my_size);
 *
 * They both return 0 on success, or some error code on failure.
 *
 * TODO later:
 * How about an atomic_add_return for the prod?  Now that we use powers of two,
 * CAS is probably overkill.
 *
 * Automatically round up.
 *
 * Watch out for ABA.  Could use ctrs in the top of the indexes.  Not really an
 * issue, since that would be a wraparound.
 *
 * Consumers could also just set their bit, and have whoever has the pub_idx
 * right before them be the one to advance it all the way up.
 *
 * Using uint32_t for now, since that's the comp_and_swap we have.  We'll
 * probably get other sizes once we're sure we like the current one.  */
